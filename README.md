# 3 - Building with a static site generator

This repo holds one of a series of examples of JAMstack sites from a freeCodeCamp video. The video, "Introduction to JAMstack" is available to view for free on freeCodeCamp.

## About this example

The 3rd of our 6 code examples, this example builds on [example 2](https://findthat.at/jamstack/ex2) to begin generating more pages with the use of a [static site generator](https://staticgen.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=fcc-examples-pnh&utm_campaign=devex)

In the video, we explore what job a static site generator does, and consider what makes a good choice of SSG for us. We'll mention a few of the popular options and describe the considerations worth keeping in mind when selecting the one that suits your project and your team. then we'll step through the abstraction of content form templates and being build and deploying our site.
